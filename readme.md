# Ultimate Boat Ramp Explorer!

Hi, and welcome to the Ultimate Boat Ramp Explorer, designed for enthusiasts who love boat ramps!

This is our Full Stack technical challenge has been designed to reflect some of the work we do and the way we work. It's designed to be fun, challenging and hopefully you may learning something too! There is no right or wrong way to do this challenge, we are more interested in the choices you make along the way.

This small app works, but it has some _code smells_, _bugs_ and _bad practices_, and no-one likes that!

## What is the challenge?

The challenge comes into two parts:

### 1. The review of the App

Before the call, conduct a thorough review of the app. Make notes about any issues you notice and areas that could be improved. We recommend cloning and running the app—this will help you understand it better. At this stage, we’re not expecting you to write any code. This step usually takes up to an hour and will help you get familiar with the codebase.

Some things to think about:

- What are the app’s current issues?
- How would you introduce testing?
- How would you introduce state management?
- What improvements would you make to ensure the app is maintainable and scalable?
- What anti pattern or code smells did you found?
- Imagine that you’re responsible for this application going forward—how would you approach making it better?

We expect your review to include comments and notes that clearly explain why a particular issue is being highlighted. Wherever possible, include suggestions on how to address or improve the identified issues. This helps us understand your reasoning and thought process. When you finish with this part, please send those notes to us, so we can continue the process.

### 2. Feature request

This will be part of the paired programming session. During the session, we’ll introduce a couple of new feature requests. You’ll then brainstorm how to tackle the problem and write some code to implement it.

Please ensure you can run the app and are prepared to apply changes during the session. Double-check that your environment is set up correctly and that the app runs as expected to avoid any delays. If you have any question do not hesitate to asks.

## Development setup

To get the app up and running, follow these steps:

- Make sure you have Node.js (22 or higher) and a modern browser installed.

- Clone this repository locally.

- Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

- Open your browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:3000/

You should see something like this:

## Continual improvement

We’re always looking to improve, and we learn from every candidate who participates in this challenge. After completing the process, we may reach out to ask for your feedback. Your insights help us refine the challenge and make it even better for future participants.

Thanks for taking the time to explore the Ultimate Boat Ramp Explorer. We’re excited to see what you come up with!
